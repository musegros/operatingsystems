File: shell.c
Instructions to Compile: gcc shell.c -o shell
Instructions to Run: After compiling, type ./shell

Challenges: I had difficulty using the man pages for guidance on using getenv,
setenv, etc. I had to see how other students implemented the functions to
understand the syntax.

Sources: Google, man pages, other students.
